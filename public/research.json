Climate mitigation will require a nearly complete overhaul of the global energy sector in the next few decades to avoid significant increases in global average temperatures and associated climate change.

Both mitigation and adaptation will be costly and require public financing (Ekins & Speck, Citation2014; Jones et al. Citation2013; Martín, Citation2021). Martín (Citation2021) has noted that cities will need public finance for coastal climate adaptation because the costs will reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually in the United States by the 2030s. Public finance is a proven way to pay for infrastructure projects and offers a way to invest in adaptation that focuses on public benefits rather than private gain. Given the importance of public finance to coastal climate adaptation, local governments will face enormous cost burdens and need to draw on municipal, state, and federal funds to finance adaptation projects across infrastructure, services to reduce social vulnerability, and risk management instruments (Cleveland et al., Citation2019)."

Climate Central has estimated that just 3 ft of SLR in Florida would affect 300,000 homes worth $145 billion (Strauss et al., Citation2014). Florida TaxWatch, a think tank and government watchdog, has estimated that residential flooding will remove $350 million from local governments’ property tax base by 2045 (Florida TaxWatch, Citation2020). The Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council (Citation2021) has estimated the region will lose $7.5 billion in taxable property by 2060 with 3.5 ft of SLR, and infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrades will incur at least $7.2 billion in expenditures, creating a net gap of almost $15 billion."
